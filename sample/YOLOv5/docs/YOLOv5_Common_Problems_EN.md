# YOLOv5 Common Problems
## 1. Anchors with Inconsistent Sizes
If the predicted detection box has a center position that closely matches the actual target center position, **but its size is significantly different**, such as being much larger than the target, it indicates that the preset anchor sizes are inconsistent with the target sizes.

Typically, the YOLO algorithm checks the effectiveness of the preset anchor sizes before training. If they do not meet the requirements, the algorithm will re-cluster the sizes of the anchors based on the sizes of the annotated detection boxes in the training dataset to generate suitable anchor sizes. Therefore, when transferring the algorithm for inference, **it is necessary to manually adjust the anchor sizes to match those generated by clustering before training.**

The general operation method is to load the model with the original code, set a breakpoint, and check the anchor parameters in the model. Below is the Python code provided to view the anchor parameters in the YOLOv5 weights in the open-source repository.

```python
import torch
from models.experimental import attempt_load
modelPath = 'Your_Model_Path'
model = attempt_load(modelPath, map_location=torch.device('cpu'))
m = model.module.model[-1] if hasattr(model, 'module') else model.model[-1]
print(f"little targets' anchors : {m.anchors[0]*m.stride[0]}")
print(f"middle targets' anchors : {m.anchors[1]*m.stride[1]}")
print(f"large  targets' anchors : {m.anchors[2]*m.stride[2]}")
```

## 2. Other Questions
1. Preprocessing is not aligned. For example, YOLOv5 uses gray edge filling (letterbox) to resize images and cannot be directly resized.
2. If you are using a single-output YOLOv5 model, the decoding part corresponding to the calculation layer should not be quantized.
3. When compiling the bmodel, make sure to specify the `--target` parameter consistent with the device you are deploying on (BM1684/BM1684X).
4. If you are unable to load the model properly, try using `bm-smi` to check the TPU status and utilization. If any exceptions occur (TPU status is Fault or utilization is 100%), please contact technical support or create an issue on GitHub.
5. For more methods on precision alignment, you can refer to the [Precision Alignment Guide](../../../docs/FP32BModel_Precise_Alignment.md).
