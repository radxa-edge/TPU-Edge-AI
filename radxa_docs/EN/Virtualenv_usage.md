## Python Virtual Environment

Due to potential inconsistencies or version conflicts in package dependencies between different Python applications, it is advisable to create a virtual environment for each application. This helps in isolating dependencies and maintaining a clean environment. We recommend using `virtualenv` to manage virtual environments. Below is a tutorial on how to use `virtualenv` for managing Python virtual environments.

### Tutorial on Creating and Using Virtual Environments

1. **Download virtualenv** (skip if already installed):

    ```bash
    pip3 install virtualenv
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment in the application directory**:

    ```bash
    python3 -m virtualenv .venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. **Update pip inside the virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    ```

5. **Deactivate the virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

6. **Delete the virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    rm -rf .venv
    ```
